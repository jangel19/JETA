# 🏗️ JETA AI – Property Intelligence for Developers & Investors

**JETA** is a smart platform built for real estate developers, investors, and micro-entrepreneurs. It uses AI to break down zoning laws, identify buildable opportunities, estimate development costs, and help users reinvest gains — all through a modern, automated workflow.

> 🚀 This project is currently in development for the **UMass Lowell DifferenceMaker** competition.

## 💡 Problem We're Solving

Navigating zoning laws, estimating construction feasibility, and reinvesting in real estate is a time-consuming and costly process for small developers. Tools like zoning maps, code books, and pro forma sheets are fragmented and often require expert interpretation or expensive consultants. International and commercial real estate analysis is even harder to access and automate.

**JETA centralizes and simplifies this process using AI**, so small teams and individual investors can scale like large firms.

## 🌟 Vision

JETA is not a consumer home search site — it’s a **high-leverage decision engine** for serious builders, buyers, and investors. By combining real-time data, AI, and smart automation, we’re democratizing the tools that only large developers and private equity firms usually have access to.
